Light fence circuit is used to detect the presence of any human or
object in a particular area. The detecting range of Light Fence Circuit
is about 1.5 to 3 meters. It’s quite simple to design the circuit using
LDR and Op-amp. This portable circuit can work smoothly with a
commonly available 9V battery and the alarm sound generated from
the buzzer is loud enough to detect the presence of a human, vehicle
or object. LDR is placed facing towards the entrance and a potentiometer is
used to adjust the sensitivity of the device. You can also add a switch
between the negative pin of the battery and LDR’s grounded pin to
control this security system manually.
From this experiment we can have many advantages that is It is quiet
easy to make it is used in security systems to identify the
miscellaneous objects are not entered into the restricted area if any
object is trying to enter into the restricted area then the system used
gives signal in the form of buzzer and light will glow then we can
identify the miscellaneous objects.
